Let us say we have a list of 14 players with their number associated.

p5 is the number of the person which received the 5th highest number.

Their rankings will be:
p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, ..., p14

Let us say p6 and p7 are two players which follow themselves in the rankings (but they do not know that!), and then should have different colors.

What p6 sees is:
p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p7, p8....

By convention, each player puts itself first in the permutation he infers. 
The permutation for p6 is then the following:
p6, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p7, p8, p9..., p14

What p7 sees is:
p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p8...

The permutation for p7 is then the following:
p7, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p8, ..., p14

The permutations inferred by each player are in fact permutations of p1, p2, ...p14.
And the parities of the permutation of p6 and the permutation of p7 have different signatures (the two permutations differ by only one transposition)
If we put 0 for the odd permutations and 1 for the even permutations, we will have alternate bits at the end.
