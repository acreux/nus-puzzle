Let s say we have a list of 14 players with their number associated.

Their order will be:
p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p..., p14

Let s say p6 and p7 are tow players which follow themselves in order(but they do not know that!), and then should have different colors.

What p6 sees is:
p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p7, p8....

Let s note it the view:
p6, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p7, p8, p9..., p14

What p7 sees is:
p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p8...

Let s note it the view:
p7, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p8, ..., p14

Views are in fact permutations of p1, p2, ...p14.
And signatures of the view of p6 and the view of p7 have different signatures. ( There is only one transition between both permutations.)
If the color is the signature of the view, we will have alternate colors at the end.
